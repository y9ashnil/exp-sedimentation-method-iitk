#### **To determine the Particle size and Particle size distribution by using Sedimentation method (Andresen Pipette)**
<ul>

<h3>1. Preparation of Suspension:</h6>
<li>Prepare a well-dispersed suspension of the sample      particles in distilled water. If the sample is very concentrated, dilute it appropriately to avoid overcrowding of particles.</li>
<li>Stir the suspension thoroughly to ensure a uniform distribution of particles. A magnetic stirrer can be used for continuous stirring. </li>

<h3>2. Fill the Andresen Pipette:</h3>
<li>Fill the Andresen Pipette with the prepared suspension, ensuring there are no air bubbles trapped inside. The pipette has a specific volume capacity (usually 50 mL or 100 mL).</li>
<li>Secure the pipette in a vertical position, with the base submerged in the liquid medium.</li>

<h3>3. Sedimentation Process:</h3>
<li>Allow the suspension to settle undisturbed for a predetermined time. The larger particles will settle faster, while smaller ones will settle more slowly.</li>
<li>At regular time intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds or 1 minute), remove a measured volume of the suspension from the pipette using a syringe or a graduated pipette. This volume should be small (typically 1-2 mL) to avoid disturbing the sediment.
</li>
<li>The amount of sediment removed represents particles that have settled over the time interval.
</li>

<h3>4. Recording the Sample:

</h3>
<li>Record the volume of the liquid extracted at each time interval and note the exact time at which each sample was taken.</li>
<li>The volume of liquid taken is inversely related to the size of the particles — the quicker the particles settle, the larger the volume will be collected in a shorter time.</li>

<h3>5. Repeat the Process:</h3>
<li>Continue extracting samples from the pipette at different time intervals (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, etc.) until the majority of the particles have settled.</li>
<li>Ensure that the sedimentation is allowed to proceed without disturbance between sampling intervals.</li>

<h3>6. Calculation of Particle Size Distribution:</h3>
<li>After the experiment, calculate the particle size distribution by plotting the volume of the sediment collected over time.
</li>
<li>The data can be analyzed by plotting a graph of the amount of sediment (volume or mass) vs. the time, and applying Stokes’ Law to calculate the average particle size for each time interval.
</li>
<li>The sedimentation velocity is related to the particle size, so by fitting the data to a mathematical model (such as the logarithmic method), you can estimate the particle size distribution.</li>
</ul>
