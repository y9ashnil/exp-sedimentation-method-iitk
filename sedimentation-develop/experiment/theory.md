### Theory of Sedimentation Method for Particle Size Distribution Determination (Using the Andresen Pipette)
<ul>
<h4>The sedimentation method for determining particle size and its distribution is based on the settling velocity of particles in a fluid under the influence of gravity. This method is particularly useful for fine particles, which cannot be accurately measured using traditional sieving techniques.</h4>
<h4>Key Concepts Involved:</h4>
<li><b>Settling Velocity:</b> The rate at which a particle settles in a fluid depends on several factors, including the particle's size, density, and the viscosity of the fluid. According to Stokes' Law, the settling velocity 
ùë£
of a spherical particle in a fluid is given by:</li>
<ul></ul>
     <h1> ùë£ = (d<sup>2</sup>(œÅ<sub>p</sub>-œÅ<sub>f</sub>)g) / 18ùúá </h1>

       
       

Where:
<li>ùë£
 = Settling velocity of the particle (m/s)</li>
<li>ùëë
= Diameter of the particle (m)</li>
<li>ùúå<sub>p</sub>
= Density of the particle (kg/m¬≥)
</li>
<li>œÅ <sub>f</sub>
‚Äã = Density of the fluid (kg/m¬≥)</li>
<li>ùëî
= Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s¬≤)</li>
<li>ùúá
= Dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa.s or N.s/m¬≤)</li>
<ul></ul>
<b>Stokes' Law</b> applies primarily to small particles (Reynolds number Re<0.1), which are in the laminar flow regime. For particles larger than a certain threshold, turbulence may occur, and the law no longer holds.>
<ul></ul>
<li><b>Sedimentation Process:</b> When a suspension of particles is placed in a fluid (e.g., water), the particles begin to settle due to gravity. Larger particles settle faster because they have higher settling velocities, while smaller particles remain suspended longer.<ul></ul>


<li><b>Time and Particle Size Relationship:</b> The sedimentation method works by collecting sediment at various time intervals. The rate of sedimentation can be used to calculate particle size. Since larger particles settle faster, the amount of sediment in the suspension will be higher at earlier time intervals, with smaller particles settling later.</li>

<li><b>Andresen Pipette: </b>The Andresen Pipette is a device designed to measure the sedimentation rate of fine particles. It operates by extracting small volumes of suspension at precise intervals, thereby enabling the determination of the particle size distribution from the time it takes for particles to settle.</li>
<ul></ul>
<h3><b>Theoretical Assumptions:</b></h3><ul></ul>
<li><b>Sphericity of Particles:</b> The method assumes that particles are roughly spherical. If the particles are irregularly shaped, the actual settling velocity will be different, and corrections need to be applied.</li>

<li><b>Laminar Flow:</b> Stokes' law assumes laminar flow around the particles, which is valid for small particles moving in a highly viscous fluid or at low velocities. For large particles or high concentrations, turbulent flow may occur, which invalidates Stokes' law.</li>

<li><b>No Interactions Between Particles:</b> The theory assumes that the particles do not interact with each other. In high-concentration suspensions, particle-particle interactions can alter the settling behavior.</li>

<li><b>Uniformity of Fluid: The fluid's viscosity and density are assumed to be uniform and constant during the experiment. Changes in temperature can affect fluid properties, so it is essential to maintain a constant temperature.</li><ul></ul>
<h3><b>Stokes' Law for Sedimentation:</b></h3>
For particles settling in a fluid, the settling velocity is proportional to the square of the particle diameter. Therefore, the larger the particle, the faster it will settle.

<ul><li>If we know the sedimentation velocity of a particle at a given time and the time taken for sedimentation, we can calculate the particle size by applying Stokes' law.</li>
<li>The equation above shows that particle diameter is proportional to the square root of the sedimentation velocity.</li></ul>
<h3><b>Application in Particle Size Distribution:</b></h3>
By measuring the volume of liquid removed from the suspension at different time intervals, one can estimate the amount of sediment that has settled. The amount of sediment and the settling time are related through Stokes' law, allowing us to calculate the particle size distribution.

<ul><li>Early Time Intervals: At the beginning of sedimentation, larger particles (with higher settling velocities) will settle first. These particles are removed in the first few samples.</li>

<li>Later Time Intervals: As sedimentation continues, smaller particles begin to settle. Over time, the suspension becomes more and more depleted of large particles, and the sedimentation of smaller particles is measured.</li>

<li>Plotting Data: A graph of the amount of sediment collected versus time can be used to determine the particle size distribution. This is often done by plotting the cumulative volume of sediment versus time, which can be related back to the particle size.</li>

<ul><li>Faster Settling Particles: Correspond to larger particles (high settling velocities).</li>
<li>Slower Settling Particles: Correspond to smaller particles (low settling velocities).</li></ul></ul>
<h3><b>Determination of Particle Size Distribution:</b></h3>
<li>Time Interval Sampling: At each time interval, a small sample of the suspension is withdrawn from the Andresen Pipette. The amount of sediment collected correlates to the size of the particles settling at that time.</li>

<li>Using Stokes' Law: By knowing the particle density, fluid viscosity, and fluid density, Stokes' law can be used to compute the particle size for each time interval. The sedimentation time for each sample gives an indication of the particle size at that point.</li>

<li>Cumulative Sediment Volume: A cumulative sediment volume vs. time curve can be plotted, which can then be used to deduce the particle size distribution by relating sedimentation time to particle size. The larger particles will contribute to the initial rapid increase in sediment volume, while smaller particles will only begin to settle after a longer time.</li>
